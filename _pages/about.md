I hold my PhD in Economics from the University of Leicester with a focus on industrial and experimental economics. My research interests are _timing of product introductions_, _product un/bundling_, _competition, market regulation, nationalisation, decision errors under risk, framing effects_ and _reinforcement learning_.

I hold my MSc in Financial Economics from the University of Glasgow and my Bachelor's Degree in World Economy from Qafqaz University.

I am a **Fellow** of the Advance HE, **FHEA**.

I currently work as a Teaching Fellow at the University of Warwick Department of Economics, where I deliver lectures and seminars on various quantitative economics modules, including industrial economics with a focus on behavioural economics, intermediate microeconomics, advanced game theory, and development economics. Also, I supervise thesis projects of bachelor’s and master’s degree students in my area of specialisation.

I hold my PhD in Economics from the University of Leicester with a focus on industrial and experimental economics. My research interests are _timing of product introductions_, _product un/bundling_, _competition, market regulation, nationalisation, decision errors under risk, framing effects_ and _reinforcement learning_.

I hold my MSc in Financial Economics from the University of Glasgow and my Bachelor's Degree in World Economy from Qafqaz University.

I am a **Fellow** of the Advance HE, **FHEA**.

I currently work as a Teaching Associate at the University of Manchester Department of Economics, where I deliver seminars on various quantitative economics modules, including managerrial economics, intermediate microeconomics, advanced maths, and macroeconomics. Also, I supervise MSc thesis projects in my area of specialisation.

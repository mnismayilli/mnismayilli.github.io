I hold a **PhD in Economics** from the University of Leicester, with a research focus on **industrial** and **experimental economics**. My academic interests span a broad range of topics, including _timing of product introductions_, _product bundling and unbundling_, _market competition and regulation_, _nationalisation_, _decision-making under risk_, _framing effects_, and _learning dynamics_.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned an **MSc in Financial Economics** from the University of Glasgow and a **Bachelor's degree in Economics** from Baku Engineering University (Qafqaz University).

I am a **Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA)**, committed to excellence in teaching and learning in higher education.

Currently, I serve as a **Teaching Associate** in the Department of Economics at the University of Manchester. I lead seminars across a range of quantitative economics modules, including **Managerial Economics**, **Intermediate Microeconomics**, **Advanced Mathematics**, and **Industrial Organisation**. In addition to teaching, I supervise **MSc dissertation projects** aligned with my areas of expertise.

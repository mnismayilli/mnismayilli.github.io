<!-- ## Teaching Philosophy

My pedagogical philosophy is grounded in the conviction that education constitutes a dynamic, interactive process whereby students actively construct knowledge rather than merely receive it. Having engaged with diverse educational systems throughout my academic formation, I recognise that effective teaching necessitates the creation of environments wherein critical thinking and independent enquiry may flourish. 

In my economics tutorials and lectures, I position myself as a facilitator of intellectual discovery, employing case studies, research projects, and structured debates that challenge students to analyse complex economic phenomena from multiple perspectives whilst interrogating underlying assumptions. 

Inclusivity, diversity and equality are fundamental to my practice—I utilise varied pedagogical methods to accommodate diverse learning styles, incorporate examples from different cultural contexts, and establish flexible assessment opportunities that ensure every student feels valued and supported. I regard teaching as an evolving discipline, actively pursuing innovations in pedagogy and educational technology whilst systematically soliciting student feedback to enhance my instruction's relevance and efficacy. My commitment extends beyond enabling students to master economic concepts to nurturing thoughtful, capable citizens who can critically evaluate policy implications and contribute meaningfully to societal discourse. Through mentorship and emphasis upon the ethical dimensions of economic choices, I endeavour to develop not merely skilled economists but informed individuals who recognise their responsibility to engage constructively with complex global challenges, empowering them to become lifelong learners and thoughtful leaders. -->

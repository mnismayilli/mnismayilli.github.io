# Mehman Ismayilli
## PhD in Economics

I hold my PhD in Economics from the University of Leicester. My research interests lie in the fields of _experimental economics, industrial organisation_ and _ Machine Learning (ML) and AI_. I am particularly interested in _decision errors under risk_, _product quality upgrades_, _externalities_ and the replication of _economic theories in ML_. 

I am a Teaching Fellow at the [Department of Economics at the University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/mismayilli). In addition, I have been an Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (AFHEA) since September 2020.
